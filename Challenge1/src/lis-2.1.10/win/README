README for Microsoft Build Engine
=================================

Run the following command to generate Makefile 
(See configure.bat --help for details): 

> configure.bat
 
To build the library, run the following command:

> nmake 

If win32.mak is not found in your computing environment,
download SDK for Windows 7 from Microsoft's home page and
install it. Then set path to the directory where win32.mak locates
(C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1A\Include,
for example) by adding it to your environment variable INCLUDE.
You can also locate it by installing Visual Studio with
option 'Windows XP Support for C++'.

To ensure that the library has been built successfully, enter

> nmake check

The following command copies the library files to lis-($VERSION)\lib,
the header files to lis-($VERSION)\include, and the executable files
to lis-($VERSION)\bin, respectively:

> nmake install
