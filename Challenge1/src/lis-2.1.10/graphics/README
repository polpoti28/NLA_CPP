* GNUPLOT


- Residual Histories

To generate example file 'residual_histories.eps' on UNIX systems, 
run the following sample script:

> ./gnuplot1.sh

On Windows systems, edit the path to gnuplot.exe in gnuplot1.bat
and run the script as follows:

> gnuplot1.bat

gnuplot1b.sh and gnuplot1b.bat are more sophisticated versions
for gnuplot 4.4 or later. 


- Matrix Pattern

To generate example file 'matrix_pattern.eps' on UNIX systems, 
run gnuplot2.sh as follows:

> ./gnuplot2.sh ../test/testmat.mtx

On Windows systems, edit the path to gnuplot.exe in gnuplot2.bat
and run as follows:

> gnuplot2.bat ..\test\testmat.mtx


- Distribution of Real Eigenvalues

To generate example file 'distribution_of_real_eigenvalues.eps'
on UNIX systems, run the following sample script:

> ./gnuplot3.sh

On Windows systems, edit the path to gnuplot.exe in gnuplot3.bat
and run the script as follows:

> gnuplot3.bat


- Distribution of Complex Eigenvalues

To generate example file 'distribution_of_complex_eigenvalues.eps'
on UNIX systems, run the following sample script:

> ./gnuplot4.sh

On Windows systems, edit the path to gnuplot.exe in gnuplot4.bat
and run the script as follows:

> gnuplot4.bat

You can generate 'distribution_of_Ritz_values.eps' by running ./gnuplot4b.sh
or ./gnuplot4b.bat.


- Eigenvectors

To generate example file 'eigenvectors.eps' on UNIX systems, 
run the following sample script:

> ./gnuplot5.sh

On Windows systems, edit the path to gnuplot.exe in gnuplot5.bat
and run the script as follows:

> gnuplot5.bat

gnuplot5.sh and gnuplot5.bat are for gnuplot 4.4 or later.
